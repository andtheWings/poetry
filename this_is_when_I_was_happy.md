# This is when I was happy

hit refresh and hope for something different
or something the same, i mean, but better,
still got that composition of sand in the swimtrunks
and shells sifting through your fingers

but this time with a vintage photo filter
and a snorkel cruise comin’ next
with the dolphins getting sassy in the air
water dripping all velvet off their noses
as they crest over top your head

but hey i’ve never snorkled
‘cept for in a Magic School Bus
game i used to boot up
on the old gateway 2000, dust
coughing out its vents as it sank
into irrelevant quicksand and

all i’m sayin’ is it’s hard to recycle nostalgia
when some of it ain’t actually real

some of it just that shit you pull
out your ears in bed when you can’t sleep
and you think

this is when i was happy
(with the dolphins)
and even if it ain’t true,
why can’t i have it now?

and why are all these red numbers
on my window so distracting? and why
a dog ain’t your dog

‘til you post her running into a tennis net on the internet and i wonder what those webs been up to since i last checked (3 minutes ago) and sometimes a little pen on paper the only way to escape? though i can’t seem to scratch out a rabbit hole same ways as before with a metaphor about the bird cage and it wouldn’t matter if i could cuz that one’s floatin’ in the zeroes by now and everyone could and would see the self-riffiffication that is they bothered to read the damn thing at all: “i’d like to like that thing you posted i remember liking but i’m a little busy right now with my life (looking at cat gifs) and do i have a life? and ain’t it just a little disingenuous to blame your apps for this when everyone been struggling with their grains of salt in the sea long before Zuckie-B made his advertising scrapbook? i could dredge up old memories and write your ears off (eyes off?) ‘bout how i used to snuggle with Ella the Beagle under my parents’ bed and i could gloss over how i used to do that cuz i was tired and scared and bored with shit even at 6 and i could point to those moments when i used to put my ear to her belly and practice breathin’ the same way she breathed and i could lament oh my god will i ever feel that way again? but hey there’s an honest-to-jesus dog lying on top my legs right now and she’s got a cone round her head and it’s makin’her snort cuz her wet, black nose is smooshed against the plastic and there’s some old drool sliding down the ridges toward her eye and her legs keep kickin’ when she sees a rabbit in her dreams while she goes ruh ruh ruh in a high-pitched not-so-intimidating squeak and eff this i got some pettin’ to do
