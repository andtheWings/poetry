# Brain Blips

spicy food sends the same brain blips as fire
but i'd rather lick a pepper
than a red hot coil

and it ain't the danger that make the difference
but the complex lift
of what i can and cannot take

the oozey lava-like spectrum shifting further
and further and further

and i'd rather tear my muscles
lifting my sweetheart to the sun
than pull my body out a pit

and i'd rather a hound crush my fingers in her jaw
than type it down the carpal tunnel

and all this prickling pressure builds inside my skull
and makes me want to scream

but i'd rather face it running circles round a trail
than wait resigned in a sagging couch
