If I could be the unbridled cause of laughter, I would gallop up and down the food court at the local shopping mall.  I would kick over tables, send french fries and Chinese noodles crashing to the ground.  I would gather up loose shopping bags in my mouth.  Chew on expensive lingerie, scented candles, and bath salts with a toothy grin.  I would canter stride for stride along painted ponies on the merry-go-round.
